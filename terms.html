Serious indiscipline on the part of even a single delegate may require the dismissal, without refund, of the individual involved and his or her delegation from the Conference.

                        The Secretary General/organizing committee reserves the right to amend the country/council matrix. Country and council allotments are solely under the discretion of the organizing committee members. Delegates are required to pay their Delegation Fees as soon as a delegate has been registered for COEPMUN 2016 in capacity as a Delegate or a Press Corps Reporter. First-Come-First-Serve policy shall not entirely be applicable to all allotments for COEPMUN 2016. Delegate allotments will be made on the basis of past Model UN experience to maintain decorum & ensure the highest quality of debate. Preference allotment probability is bound to decrease through the participation timeline. Countries and committees will be allotted only after payment. Delegates from schools may not be allotted committees apart from a few designated ones. This clause has been drafted solely for the purpose of enhancing delegate experience of the younger delegates into the right pattern of MUNning.
